#### Change Log:

- Version 1.0 - 4/26/2020
- Version 1.1 - 4/7/2023
  - Updated to `MouseMotionAdapter.onMouseDragged` instead of spinning up a new thread to handle dragged cards.
  - Implemented `ComponentAdapter.componentResized` to recompute size and the spacing of and between elements respectively, instead of recomputing on every paint.
  - Rewrote most of the front and back end, so very likely introduced bugs that I will stumble upon and spend a weekend fixing... three years later?
  - Learned that you cannot move entire stacks of tableau cards because you can only stack opposite color cards on top of one another in Solitaire.
    - When I envisioned the game the first time around, I was really thinking about _Spider Solitaire_.
    - I ended up implementing a way to move entire stacks at once, if I may so brag, but deleted it because I found it that was not actually part of the Solitaire ruleset. Check the commits if you do not believe me. Go on, I will not mind, I promise.
  - I had a blast. And that is what it is all about, is it not? Having fun? ðŸ˜Š
  - Linted the Java files according to the RedHat linter on VSCode.
